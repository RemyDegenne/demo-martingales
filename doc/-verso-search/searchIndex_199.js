For example, subtraction truncates to zero.\nIf one finds that lemma lemma_name used to transform an equation does not apply to ℝ≥0∞, a good thing to try is to find a lemma named like ENNReal.lemma_name_of_something and use that instead (it will typically require that one variable is not infinite).\n\nFor many lemmas to apply, the set s will need to be a measurable set. The way to express that is MeasurableSet s.\n\n","context":"Probability in Mathlib\u0009Probability spaces and probability measures","header":"1.1.
