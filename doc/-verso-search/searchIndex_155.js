ℱ is a monotone sequence of sub-sigma-algebras of m. The sigma-algebra at index i is ℱ i.\n\nWe can state that a process X is adapted to the filtration ℱ with adapted ℱ X.\nWe can write that it is a martingale with respect to ℱ and the measure P : Measure Ω with Martingale X ℱ P.\n\nA stopping time with respect to a filtration ℱ is a function τ : Ω → ι such that for all i, the preimage of {j | j ≤ i} along τ is measurable with respect to ℱ i.\nIsStoppingTime ℱ τ states that τ is a stopping time.\n\nRemark: there is an issue with the current definition of stopping times, which is that if the index set of the filtration ι is the set of natural numbers ℕ then τ has to take values in ℕ. In particular it cannot be infinite.\nThat can cause friction with informal stopping times which are often understood to be infinite when they are not well defined.\n\n","context":"Probability in Mathlib\u0009Various probability definitions","header":"3.6.
