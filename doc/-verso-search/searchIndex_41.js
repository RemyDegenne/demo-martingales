With that notation, P[s|t] = P[|t] s.\n\nFor X : Ω → E and x : E, we write P[|X ← x] for the probability measure conditioned on X = x. It is notation for P[|X ⁻¹' {x}].\nThis is meaningful only if X = x has non-zero probability, so that definition is mostly useful for discrete probability.\n\n","context":"Probability in Mathlib\u0009Various probability definitions\u0009Conditioning","header":"3.4.1.
