The assumption hX states that X is measurable, which is necessary for most manipulations.\n\nIf we define a measure P on Ω, we can talk about the law or distribution of a random variable X : Ω → E.\nThe law of X is a measure on E, with value P (X ⁻¹' s) on any measurable set s of E.\nThis is how we define the map of the measure P by X, Measure.map X P or more succinctly P.map X.\nThere is no specific notation for that law.\nTo say that X is Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1, write P.map X = gaussianReal 0 1.\n\nThe expectation of X is the integral of that function against the measure P, written ∫ ω, X ω ∂P.\nThe notation P[X] is shorthand for that expectation. In a MeasureSpace, we can further use the notation 𝔼[X].\n\nRemark: there are two types of integrals in Mathlib, Bochner integrals and Lebesgue integrals.\nThe expectation notations stand for the Bochner integral, which is defined for X : Ω → E with E a normed space over ℝ ([NormedAddCommGroup E] [NormedSpace ℝ E]).\nThey don't work for Y : Ω → ℝ≥0∞ since ℝ≥0∞ is not a normed space, but those functions can be integrated with the Lebesgue integral: ∫⁻ ω, Y ω ∂P.\nThere is no expectation notation for the Lebesgue integral.\n\n","context":"Probability in Mathlib\u0009Probability spaces and probability measures","header":"1.2.
