This is a random variable Ω → F, and it is m-measurable.\nThe conditional expectation of Y given X : Ω → E can be obtained with P[Y | mE.comap X], in which mE : MeasurableSpace E is the sigma-algebra on E.\nThe sigma-algebra mE.comap X (or MeasurableSpace.comap X mE) on Ω is the sigma-algebra generated by X. It is the smallest sigma-algebra for which all the sets X ⁻¹' s are measurable, for s ranging over the measurable sets on E.\n\nWe have special notation for the conditional expectation of the real indicator of a set s : Set Ω: P⟦s | m⟧ : Ω → ℝ.\n\n","context":"Probability in Mathlib\u0009Various probability definitions\u0009Conditioning","header":"3.4.2.
