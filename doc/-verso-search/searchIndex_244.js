That is, for every measurable set s of F, the function fun x ↦ κ x s is measurable.\nTransition kernels are represented in Mathlib by the type Kernel E F.\nA kernel such that all measures in its image are probability measures is called a Markov kernel. This is denoted by IsMarkovKernel κ.\nThere are other typeclasses for kernels that are finite (IsFiniteKernel) or s-finite (countable sum of finite, IsSFiniteKernel).\n\nKernels are perhaps more widely used in Mathlib than one would expect. For example independence and conditional independence are both expressed as special cases of a notion of independence with respect to a kernel and a measure.\n\n\n","context":"Probability in Mathlib\u0009Various probability definitions","header":"3.7.
