For example, with the Borel sigma-algebra the open sets are measurable and continuous functions are measurable.\nFor that we first need Ω to be a topological space and we then need to add a [BorelSpace Ω] variable.\n\n\n\nFor properties related to conditional distributions, it is often convenient or necessary to work in a standard Borel space (a measurable space arising as the Borel sets of some Polish topology). See the StandardBorelSpace typeclass.\nNote that a countable discrete measurable space is a standard Borel space, so there is no need to worry about that typeclass when doing discrete probability.\n\n\n","context":"Probability in Mathlib\u0009Probability spaces and probability measures","header":"1.4.
